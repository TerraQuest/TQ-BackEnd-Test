# TQ Backend Interview Tasks

This application is a simple API that allows a caller to see users and messages and to create new users.

It uses EntityFramework for data access.

This is version 0.1 of the app and the app is going to get a lot bigger, with many more operations and queries expected to be added to it. The solution is currently very simple but will be required to support many more entities and complex business roles. It will be critical to the business, which will expect the solution to be robust and reliable.
